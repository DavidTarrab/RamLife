flutter:

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - images/icons/baseball.png
    - images/icons/basketball.png
    - images/icons/hockey.png
    - images/icons/soccer.png
    - images/icons/tennis.png
    - images/icons/volleyball.png
    - images/logos/drive.png
    - images/logos/google.png
    - images/logos/outlook.jpg
    - images/logos/schoology.png
    - images/logos/senior_systems.png
    - images/logos/ramaz/ram_rectangle.png
    - images/logos/ramaz/ram_square_words.png
    - images/logos/ramaz/ram_square.png
    - images/logos/ramaz/teal.jpg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
